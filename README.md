# Payroll system
This repository contains a comprehensive payroll system implementation, adhering to the principles of OOP specifically for C++.

There is no doubt that enterprises, both big and small, are always seeking innovative solutions to make internal processes more efficient, resource and timewise. A payroll is one of the most relevant operations that occur within a corporation. It includes a set of processes that range from salary and benefits calculations to deductions, taxes and printed reports with the core aspects of the calculations mentioned.

Although there are already big solutions available in the market, such as SAP's payroll management system, these solutions are **expensive and complicated** to implement for small businesses. Another highlight is that it can be used in diverse industries, such as entertainment, grocery stores and real estate.

**Object-Oriented Programming**\n
By modelling the solution using OOP's principles, it allows for the code to be reused, while improving readability and performance. In this way, objects can be specific parts of the program, which have attributes and methods. For instance, some classes that can be included as part of my solution are: Person, Administrator, Employee, System, and Benefits.
